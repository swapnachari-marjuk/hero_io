# 🦸‍♂️ Hero IO – React Assignment Project

This is a **demo project** I built as part of an assignment.  
I created **fake JSON data** and fetched it to display dynamically across different pages in the UI.

## 🛠️ Tech & Libraries Used

- **React** & **React Router** – for building a smooth, component-based frontend  
- **Tailwind CSS** – for modern and responsive styling  
- **Toastify** – for toast notifications  
- **DaisyUI** – ready-made UI components  
- **Lucide Icons** – clean and minimal icons  
- **Recharts** – for charts and visual data representation

## ⚙️ Functionality

Some **interactive features** have been implemented to make the demo feel like a real project:  

- **Install / Uninstall apps** – uses LocalStorage to simulate real installation behavior  
- Installed apps will persist across pages, and will remain “installed” until uninstalled  

> Note: These functionalities are **for demonstration purposes only**, and the data is fake.
